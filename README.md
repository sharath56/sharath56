<<<Hi! I'm SharathğŸ–– and I'm an Engineer. I love designing and building a variety of circuits, programming, and executing them.
My passion for circuit designing drives me to learn more and experiment with new things.
I began constructing simple circuits from the scratch in the 2nd year of engineering and made my way to complex circuits and programming eventually by learning more about Arduino, Raspberry Pi, esp series, and so on. 
I'm passionate about embedded systems and working on projects involving them.I also enjoy working in the field of computer networking, circuit simulation, sensors, microcontrollers, and IoT. 
Though building circuits and programming comes with its own challenges, my passion for this field drives me to learn more and find solutions.
now Im into medical IOT and medical image analysis..>>>>
